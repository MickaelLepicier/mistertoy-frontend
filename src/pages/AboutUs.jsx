      <h3>Why is the store called "Mister-Toy"?</h3>
      <p>
        The meaning of the word "Mister-Toy" in Hebrew hints at a "hint of
        light"! Our gift wrapping suggests that there's something special
        underneath, and when the children open their presents â€” you can see the
        light in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We chose to wrap gifts aesthetically to emphasize the gift inside. We
        believe that wrapping should only hint at its content, to allow you and
        your children to appreciate the gift even more.
